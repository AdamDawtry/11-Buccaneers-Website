      builds of our York Pirate Game project, along with download and GitHub
      links, screenshots and information about each of them.

    <h3>All Snapshots</h3>

      Welcome to the snapshots page. Each snapshot is indicative of a
      significant stage of progress in the project that will no doubt be ridden
      with bugs. The version downloads are a .zip file containing the source
      code as well as a .jar file which you can run independently from anywhere.

    <p>
      The first snapshot is about as basic as it gets. The goal was simply to
      have a ship which you can control and move with WASD and little area to
      move around in. Nothing is pretty; all the tiles are just flat colours and
      the ship is a rectangle that isn't even filled in, but when starting out
      it's always function over form. At this stage the land tiles (the green
      squares) don't have any collision so you can very quickly sail out of
      bounds of the viewport.

      alt="Very simple ocean surrounded by land in which a rudimentary ship moves around."
    />
    <p>
      There's a little bit of text in the bottom-left of the screen to track the
      ship's speed for debugging purposes, i.e. checking if the acceleration is
      behaving correctly, the ship's speed is properly capping out at its
      maximum etc. etc.
